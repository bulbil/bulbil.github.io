## What is it to edit text?

The interface and its predominant metaphors (page, file, folder, desktop, etc.) encapsulate and describe machine processes for human ends. They are certainly tied up in the economic and military histories of digital computing, in a certain sense culminating in Engelbart's 1968 ["Mother of All Demos"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos). You might even recognize earlier threads. New geographically and temporally sprawling organizations attempting to operate at unprecedented scales--think railroad industry, telegraph networks and other artifacts of Victorian industrialization--needed new ways of organizing people and information. What were often informal, certainly homegrown information management practices in turn solidified into many of the tools of information management we recognize today. (For a more thorough discussion, you might check out [this wonderful article](http://job.sagepub.com/content/19/3/5.abstract) by JoAnne Yates). 

How do these references to physical practices map on to the steps actually taken by the machine? When any step can be replaced by an intermediary abstracted process, what work happens when you try to figure out what is "actually" happening?

## Git as an alternate imagining of interacting with data, with text.

### The basics:

#### get a copy of an existing repository from GitHub
`git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository]`

#### initialize the repository
`git init`

#### adding files / staging changes
`git add [filename]`

#### commiting changes
`git commit -m "[commit message]"`

### Dealing with the repository:

#### set the address of the remote repository
`git remote add origin https://github.com/[user]/[repo].git`

#### push your changes to the repository
`git push -u origin master`

#### merge changes on the remote side (i.e., made by others)
`git pull origin master`

## How do you create and store data most often? How do you imagine the process to yourself?

- debster: i open and "create" msword documents and hit ctrl s to save... name the file... it appears in my documents folder... sometimes i email myself a copy... i've honestly never thought too much about the process, but i probably would have thought whatever file saved was encoded in some computer language(s) i am unable to read.

- sdiamon2: I previously thought that in order to create a file I had to open Pages and press the button that said create new document. A digital sheet of paper would appear on the screen and then I would tell my computer to save the new document. I name the document something appropriate and then save it to my desktop. Later, I move the files that I have saved from my desktop to a USB that is organized by semester. I can retrieve the document there at my leisure. If I need to send the document to someone else or to store it in Dropbox or on Moodle I export it as either a PDF or a Word document and then also save that to the USB for future reference. I had absolutely no idea about the inner workings of my computer until approximately a week ago, however. I also do not think that my current understanding of said inner workings is very good. I am simply aware that a lot of strange and complex things are happening in the bowels of my computer.

- Rachel: 
I create data as plain-text files which I then save to Dropbox locally, which then auto-syncs; as Word-ish style Drive documents; as LaTeX files on ShareLaTeX; at a certain point, I decide I need a new document and copy and paste my working text into anew document labeled "draft 2."

I imagine the process to myself as saving drafts of a paper document; when I work with my collaborator, we use the "comment" function on Drive docs to leave messages for each other; when I finish editing a document, I often leave a comment for myself at the top of the document noting changes made for when I come back. Oddly, I use the old "comment out" html markup to make these comments, despite the fact that it has no function in the markup systems I currently use. 

- alli shultes: 
>I most often use GoogleDocs to create and store data. 
>I imagine myself creating multiple "documenmts" that are saved to *the cloud,* which can then be recalled
>and pulled as I decide to recall previous revisions. I'm not sure what I think *the cloud* is, but my 
>mental image looks something like cotton candy. This was also very much informed by Rachel's pigeon-hole
>tutorial.   

- nabil kashyap: I have access to local memory, I write changes to local memory, depending on the data, it might be packaged up in another file format, it may be written to disk just like that. There are copies generated--temp files, indexes--that are (hopefully) deleted when made unnecessary. Increasingly, there is some kind of remote storage, a data center somewhere, my little packet pinballed through load balancers and network hubs to a cooled storage unit somewhere in the universe.
