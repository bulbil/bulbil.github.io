###API Basics

What is an API?

Making queries

jQuery / cURL
 

TUTORIALS:

[A Codular tutorial for PHP's cURL library](http://codular.com/curl-with-php)


###Free Development Tools

There are many, *many* cloud based services with free tiers to get apps off the ground. The following are few popular options chosen largely because of the support and user community available -- by no means exhaustive or objective for that matter.

* [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com)
    This service offers a data store and realtime data syncing through an API -- basically like cheating, no need for a back end at all really. Particularly useful for saving you from data headaches if you are building a mobile app.
    * TUTORIALS:
        [This tutorial](https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/#gettingstarted) should help get you started.
* [Amazon Web Service](http://aws.amazon.com/free/?nc2=h_ql)
    Their free tier offers enough processing and storage to get started with your very own virtual private server. A bit more work and in exchange you get complete control over your server environment. 
    * TUTORIALS:
        [Amazon's tutorials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/awsgsg-intro/gsg-aws-tutorials.html)
        [one from a fellow computer science undergrad](http://www.crmarsh.com/aws/)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
    Somewhere in between the all-in-one service like Firebase and the DIY ethos of AWS. Also offers a bare bones free tier service, a little less generous than AWS, but should be plenty for most web and mobile apps out of the gate. People are particularly into its Git integration.
    * TUTORIALS:
        [Heroku's guides](https://devcenter.heroku.com/start) on how to get started in a number of languages

If you claim your [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)(which you definitely should) you can claim free access to a number of very cool tools that could be immensely helpful, for example:

* [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
    Like AWS, a virtual private server with the perks of faster disk performance and an API. Some people swear by it and more geared toward developers than the everything-to-everyone approach of AWS.
    * TUTORIALS:
    [Digital Ocean's guide to getting started](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-your-first-digitalocean-droplet-virtual-server)
* [Orchestrate](https://orchestrate.io/)
    More like Firebase, this service offers to host your database, which is exposed through an API. Another way to stress less about the back end.
