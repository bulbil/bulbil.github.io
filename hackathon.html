##API Basics

###What is an API?

###Making queries

### jQuery 

*Asynchronous* JavaScript And XML ($.ajax) is an extremely useful jQuery helper function -- a wrapper on JavaScript's XMLHttpRequest.

A couple things, however, to remember:
* It's asynchronous! So you need to be explicit about callback functions using `success`, `done` or `deferred` + `promise`.

* Depending on the API, you may need to use the flag `jsonp` to avoid cross-site scripting errors.

* Be prepared for what you're about to get back ...

```
$.ajax({
    type: 'GET',
    url: url,
    async: true,
    data: {
        "sourceResource.description": "kittens",
        "sourceResource.temporal.begin": "1888-1-01",
        "fields": "sourceResource.title,sourceResource.description,sourceResource.date",
        "api_key": [YOUR API KEY HERE]  
    },  
    dataType: 'jsonp',
    success: function(d) { [YOUR AWESOME FUNCTION] },
    error: function(e) { console.log(e.message); }
});
``` 

###Python + requests

There are several libraries that handle http requests -- for most purposes the popular library Requests is a pretty good place to start.

```
import requests
import pprint

args = { 
    "sourceResource.description": "kittens",
    "fields": "sourceResource.title,sourceResource.description,sourceResource.date",
    "api_key": [YOUR API KEY] 
    }   

response = requests.get("http://api.dp.la/v2/items", params=args)

data = response.json()

for doc in data["docs"]:
   pprint.pprint(doc)

```

RESOURCES:
* [This is a link](http://dev-trico-cc.haverford.edu/) to the brand new course guide API that was developed specifically for this weekend. For the time being, limited to Haverford IP addresses.

* [ProgrammableWeb](http://www.programmableweb.com/) is probably the largest API directory around, the downside being some of the info can be out of date.

* [PHLAPI](http://phlapi.com/index.html) is a great resource for Philly related data, including crime incidents.


TUTORIALS:
* [Codeacademy's Python API Introduction (basically how to use urllib2)](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/apis-python)

* [A Codular tutorial for PHP's cURL library](http://codular.com/curl-with-php)

* [jQuery's tutorial on Ajax](http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/) gives a great overview

##Free Development Tools

There are many, *many* cloud based services with free tiers to get apps off the ground. The following are few popular options chosen largely because of the support and user community available -- by no means exhaustive or objective for that matter.

* [Amazon Web Service](http://aws.amazon.com/free/?nc2=h_ql)
    Their free tier offers enough processing and storage to get started with your very own virtual private server. A bit more work and in exchange you get complete control over your server environment. 
    * TUTORIALS:
        [Amazon's tutorials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/awsgsg-intro/gsg-aws-tutorials.html)
        [one from a fellow computer science undergrad](http://www.crmarsh.com/aws/)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
    Somewhere in between the all-in-one service like Firebase and the DIY ethos of AWS. Also offers a bare bones free tier service, a little less generous than AWS, but should be plenty for most web and mobile apps out of the gate. People are particularly into its Git integration.
    * TUTORIALS:
        [Heroku's guides](https://devcenter.heroku.com/start) on how to get started in a number of languages
* [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com)
    This service offers a data store and realtime data syncing through an API -- basically like cheating, no need for a back end at all really. Particularly useful for saving you from data headaches if you are building a mobile app.
    * TUTORIALS:
        [This tutorial](https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/#gettingstarted) should help get you started.

If you claim your [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)(which you definitely should) you can claim free access to a number of very cool tools that could be immensely helpful, for example:

* [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
    Like AWS, a virtual private server with the perks of faster disk performance and an API. Some people swear by it and more geared toward developers than the everything-to-everyone approach of AWS.
    * TUTORIALS:
    [Digital Ocean's guide to getting started](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-your-first-digitalocean-droplet-virtual-server)
* [Orchestrate](https://orchestrate.io/)
    More like Firebase, this service offers to host your database, which is exposed through an API. Another way to stress less about the back end.
